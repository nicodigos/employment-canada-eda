    "# Some Questions to Start\n",
    "* In dimension 9, it says it doesn't count people under 15 years old in the population, but that number is different from the Labour Force in dimension 7. Is the difference related to being \"civilian\" or not? What is an institutionalized person?\n",
    "* Are people who are not working or looking for a job not counted as part of the labour force? Regarding this question, in dimension 10, it says that unemployment is for people who do not have a job but were also recently looking for one and were available for work. Since Employment + Unemployment = Labour Force, it becomes obvious that people of working age who are not working or looking for a job are not part of the labour force.\n",
